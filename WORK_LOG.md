My initial thinking was that I could use this to create the ecosystems. I made a 2D array list that represented the ecosystems, where each arraylist contained all the ints |

Before I thought that I would need a whole second algorithm to determine the number of highways because I thought there would be an optimal way to map an ecosystem, but becasue you will ALWAYS only need one highway to connect another city to the ecosystem, the amount of highways in a given ecosystems will be the number of cities minus 1. So for the whole board, total highways = total cities - total ecosystems. |

I'm going to check out those now |

I fixed this problem, and I now pass 3/6 test cases. It appears my current issue is negative numbers |

However, casting to longs doesn't fix a lot of my negative errors! I've been stuck on this for a while |
|          |                  1:25                  |                                                                                                                                                                           Okay, based on my print statements I could actually tell that my test case was ending before I run my algorithm, which means that my errors are within the test case when I check for hospitalcost < highway cost. So I went into that test case and I saw that I wasn't casting my answer to long in the formula, so I changed it and it works much better now! I now pass 5/6. My first test case isn't working simply because it times out after 1.1 seconds, and my algorithm is clearly pretty slow. My next step is to try to optimize a little. |

Therefore, my plan is to use comments to list the big O value of all steps to see where the pain points are. |
|          |                  6:30                  |                                                                                                                                         Okay, I think I found a pain point. Inside of a loop that runs on the order of O(n) times, my line to remove the newly-connected city from the 'undiscovered cities' array has to use indexOf, because undiscovered cities is an arraylist and when a city is discovered, its removed from the arraylist. My thought is to improve this efficiency by making 'undiscovered cities' into a MAP, and each index contains the city (which will be equal to the index), and if the city has been 'discovered' (added to an ecosystem), the value at the index of the city will be set to -1. |

I feel like a real programmer. I cut time my computing time dramatically. Especially for testVeryLarge(), that one was a little over 10 seconds previously, and now it's 2.87 seconds. Unfortunately, I created some errors so I'll fix those now |
|          |                  6:55                  |                                                                                                                So after fixing my errors I see that I have made things worse than they were to begin. testVeryLarge() is now 14 seconds. Uh oh. The main time-sucking part of my program now is that the program has to search through the whole 'undiscovered cities' map array for the first instance of a number that isn't -1. This basically turns the program into O(n^2). To remove this, I'll have a reigning-champion esque variable that keeps track of the smallest number NOT discovreed, so instead of having to search the array, my program will just keep track of the smallest number city it hasn't found yet. |

That testVeryLarge() case went from 10 seconds, to 2.8, to 14, and now its 0.13!! I'm happy with where I'm at |

| Sept 18  |         2:10 - 3:00 (A block)          | During this work period I implemented Union Find, using a map that stores the root of each city. By the end of the class I was working on implementing path compression. I started by making an arraylist when I would go down a path to find a root, and add every node that it took to reach the root node. Then once the root was found, I would go through the arraylist and set the root of all of the nodes in there to be the true root. However, this only made my runtimes slower, so I changed my system to just use an array, with an int variable that keeps track of how many things are in the array (I just made the array's size the order of the graph). This works better, but still has room for improvement. |

Instead of declaring and initializing an array of length n every loop, I just create one outside of the loop and then use it within. I also used this for setting the root of nodes taken to reach the root of the child node. Since i'm using a variable to keep track of where the last thing was added to the array, I can actually use the same array for both the new-root and child nodes without having to clear my arrays. |

There is no need to create an array to store the cities you look through to reach the root. If you are path compressing every search, you'll only ever have to change one city's root in the map!! Because you can only add one city to a subgraph at a time. Therefore, instead of a big array that takes memory and time, I can just have a single integer variable to do that part for me! Yay |

It doesn't make a big difference because my path compression already flattens down the trees into pancakes, but the weight balancing makes those pancakes get union-ed optimally, so it is worth including. This makes sense because weight balancing does not use any extra resources or take up more than a constant amount of added time. |
