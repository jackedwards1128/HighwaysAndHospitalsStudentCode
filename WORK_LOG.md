| Sept 11 | 11:45pm - 12:30 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I started out by creating a 2D arraylist to represent the graph. My initial thinking was that I could use this to create the ecosystems. I made a 2D array list that represented the ecosystems, where each arraylist contained all the ints |
|         |                 |                                                                                                                                          Okay, what I did before was the hard part. Before I thought that I would need a whole second algorithm to determine the number of highways because I thought there would be an optimal way to map an ecosystem, but becasue you will ALWAYS only need one highway to connect another city to the ecosystem, the amount of highways in a given ecosystems will be the number of cities minus 1. So for the whole board, total highways = total cities - total ecosystems. |

I'm going to check out those now |
| Sept 13 |     1:00pm      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          My issue was that I was basically not accounting for a single city with my algorithm because I was trying to ignore the city of number 0 (because it doesn't ever exist) but I was ALREADY accounting for zero, so this just made my queue skip over a random city. I fixed this problem, and I now pass 3/6 test cases. It appears my current issue is negative numbers |
|         |      1:10       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I imagine that given the number of digits in the expected answers, I need more than integers (need longs). However, casting to longs doesn't fix a lot of my negative errors! I've been stuck on this for a while |
|         |      1:25       |                                                            Okay, based on my print statements I could actually tell that my test case was ending before I run my algorithm, which means that my errors are within the test case when I check for hospitalcost < highway cost. So I went into that test case and I saw that I wasn't casting my answer to long in the formula, so I changed it and it works much better now! I now pass 5/6. My first test case isn't working simply because it times out after 1.1 seconds, and my algorithm is clearly pretty slow. My next step is to try to optimize a little. |
| Sept 15 |     6:20pm      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             After removing some arraylist use and seeing the drop in computation time, it's clear I have to be more intentional about my optimizing. Therefore, my plan is to use comments to list the big O value of all steps to see where the pain points are. |
|         |      6:30       |                          Okay, I think I found a pain point. Inside of a loop that runs on the order of O(n) times, my line to remove the newly-connected city from the 'undiscovered cities' array has to use indexOf, because undiscovered cities is an arraylist and when a city is discovered, its removed from the arraylist. My thought is to improve this efficiency by making 'undiscovered cities' into a MAP, and each index contains the city (which will be equal to the index), and if the city has been 'discovered' (added to an ecosystem), the value at the index of the city will be set to -1. |
|         |      6:45       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            YES! I feel like a real programmer. I cut time my computing time dramatically. Especially for testVeryLarge(), that one was a little over 10 seconds previously, and now it's 2.87 seconds. Unfortunately, I created some errors so I'll fix those now |
|         |      6:55       | So after fixing my errors I see that I have made things worse than they were to begin. testVeryLarge() is now 14 seconds. Uh oh. The main time-sucking part of my program now is that the program has to search through the whole 'undiscovered cities' map array for the first instance of a number that isn't -1. This basically turns the program into O(n^2). To remove this, I'll have a reigning-champion esque variable that keeps track of the smallest number NOT discovreed, so instead of having to search the array, my program will just keep track of the smallest number city it hasn't found yet. |

That testVeryLarge() case went from 10 seconds, to 2.8, to 14, and now its 0.13!! I'm happy with where I'm at |
